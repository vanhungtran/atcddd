\title{Compute a Checksum Manifest for Output Files}
\usage{
atc_manifest(paths)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{Character vector of file paths to include in manifest.
All paths must exist and be readable.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
\item{file}{Character; normalized absolute file path}
\item{size}{Numeric; file size in bytes}
\item{sha256}{Character; SHA256 cryptographic hash}
}
}
\description{
Generates a data frame with file paths, sizes, and SHA256 checksums.
This provides cryptographic verification of file integrity and supports
reproducible research by documenting exact file contents.
}
\section{Reproducibility}{

SHA256 checksums provide a unique fingerprint for each file. Even minor
changes to file contents will result in completely different checksums,
making this ideal for verifying data integrity and documenting exact
versions used in analyses.

# Generate manifest for crawled data
res <- atc_crawl(roots = "D", max_codes = 50)
paths <- atc_write_csv(res, dir = "data")
manifest <- atc_manifest(paths)
print(manifest)

# Check file integrity later
current_manifest <- atc_manifest(paths)
identical(manifest, current_manifest)  # TRUE if files unchanged
